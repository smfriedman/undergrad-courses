<!-- Yes you must handle comments in HTML -->

<H2>Rules:</H2>
I want you to do some critical thinking on your own but to consider
your classmates as people who can react to your ideas and give you
feedback.  I realize the distinction is tricky, so please ask
on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/ixtgwaka3mk193">piazza</a>, publicly,
if you have questions
about what is OK.
<UL>
  <LI> You may discuss concepts and design issues of
        the questions below with your classmates. 
  <LI> You may bounce ideas for your solutions off your
        classmates, and ask for their critical advice.
  <LI> Questions of the above sort should be of the form "what do you think
        of this idea" and not "how do I do this" or "how do I get started"?
  <LI> You must give credit to those who have given you critical
        feedback.  
   <UL>
    <LI> Cite them (by name) on the exam paper you turn in, and 
    <LI> credit them for the help they have given you.
    </UL>
 <LI> By turning in this exam, you acknowledge that you have:
  <UL>
    <LI>  abided by the above rules 
    <LI> abided by the 
         <a href="https://wustl.edu/about/compliance-policies/academic-policies/undergraduate-student-academic-integrity-policy/"> statement of academic integrity</a>, except
as relaxed by the above rules, and
     <LI> not done anything sneaky (seriously, just ask if you're unsure).
   </UL>

OK here goes.

<H2>Exam Questions</H2>
<OL>
  <LI> [20 points] The recognition and treatment of <I>comments</I> in programming
languages is typically handled by the scanner and not the parser.
For example:
<PRE>
// This is a comment
int foo;  /* This is another comment */
</PRE>
Why should comments be handled by the scanner
and not the parser?  Specifically, how would comments
for Java
be handled in a parser (instead of the scanner)
using a context-free grammar?

  <LI> [20 points] When a web browser fetches a page (URL), the contents of that page
is parsed and the results are shown on the screen.  If the page's contents
has a syntax error in its HTML text, no error is reported by your
browser when the page is
fetched.  For example,
<a href="bad.html">this page</a> has many HTML syntax errors and 
problems.  
<p>
Did you click on that link and everything looked OK?  Use your browser to
View Source and see all of the obvious mistakes in the HTML on that page.
<p>
Why does your browser not complain?  What are good design goals
for a browser that must handle bad HTML?
  <LI> [60 points] On the other hand, <a href="http://validator.w3.org/"> this site</a>
will validate an HTML page.  
  <OL>
   <LI> [5 points] Try it out:  What happens when you use that validation
site on:
  <UL>
    <LI> <a href="http://www.google.com"> <KBD>www.google.com</KBD></a>?  
   <LI>  itself? (<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validator</a>)
   <LI> the <a href="http://www.wustl.edu"> WUSTL home page </a>
   <LI> my <a href="bad.html">bad page</a>
  </UL>
  <LI> [55 points] Suppose you are asked to write a scanner and parser for HTML that
should accept at least
the HTML that comprises
<a href="index.txt">the page you are now viewing</a>:
(If you need a quick guide to the language,
try the <a href="http://werbach.com/barebones/barebones.html"> bare bones </a> guide).
<p>
Conveniently, there is an <TT>exam1</TT> package in your repo for you to 
do this work.
 <OL>
  <LI> [10 points] What are the
classes of tokens (the terminal alphabet) you would use to parse HTML?
  <LI> [5 points] What are the regular expressions for finding those tokens?
    (You need <I>not</I> create a working scanner for this exam.)
  <LI> [10 points] Write a context-free grammar for this subset of HTML (the one
that includes at least the markups for <a href="index.txt">the page
you are now viewing</a>,
and turn that in as part
of this problem. 
  <LI> [15 points] Test your grammar using the code base given to you, 
and try to get it to parse the good input file and reject the bad one.
      Notes:
     <UL>
      <LI> Your parser need only work on the good input file, but don't
just create rules that work for it.  Try to be as general as you can.
     </UL>
</OL>
<LI> The printout you submit should include answers to the above questions
and the console transcript of running the default
ant build, which will apply your grammar to the three input files.
<LI> Be sure to commit and push your code, as we will be looking at
it as well as the printout.
</OL>
</OL>
