ClosestPair DC implements the divide and conquer algorithm as discussed.  I decided 
to store the two points and the minimum distance as static instance variables so they 
wouldn't get lost in each level of recursion.  findClosestPair(pointsByX, pointsByY) 
calls a recursive helper method that does all the work, and then findClosestPair puts 
the points in the right order if they're out of order.  helper(pointsByX, pointsByY)
carries out the recursive divide and conquer step and the compare (yStrip) step and
returns the minimum distance.
