* WHAT'S IN HERE

This archive contains two event databases, fewEvents.txt and allEvents.txt.
The former is a subset of the latter.

There are also several query files, including one for the extra credit.

* PROVENANCE OF DATA

The allEvents database was created by merging timeline data sets from
several sources.

Science-related events were obtained from a list of historic events in
science and technology, compiled by William Nielsen Brandt
(niel@astro.psu.edu).  You can find the source at

This file also includes some historical events. Wash U.-related events
come from a no-longer-available list previously hosted at

    http://150.wustl.edu/history.html

Non-Wash U. events are adapted from the Cleveland Free-Net's history
timeline, put together by various members of that (now defunct)
service.  It concentrates on U.S. and a bit of European history.  Here

Music-related events are taken from a snapshot (10/22/2003) of the
Classical Music Timeline, which is hosted at the ClassicalWorks.com
