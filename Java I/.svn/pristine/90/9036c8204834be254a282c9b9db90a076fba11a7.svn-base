		//We can also do things like:
		int area = 7;
		double size = 8.4;
		System.out.println("The area is: " + area);

		//Conversion to String is a little different. Consider:
		String b = "" + "burrito"; //what is the result?
		System.out.println(b);
		
		String five = "" + 5; //what is the result?
		System.out.println(five);
		String mysteryString = five + 7; //what about now?
		
		System.out.print("mysteryString: " + mysteryString);
		
		//It can also be convenient to know the length of a string:
		int burritoLength = b.length();
		System.out.println("Length of a burrito: " + burritoLength);
		
		//Exercises:
		
		//What will happen with the following?
		
		System.out.println(2 + "bc");
		System.out.println(2 + 3 + "bc");
		System.out.println((2 + 3) + "bc");
		System.out.println("bc" + (2 + 3));
